# Movie Break-Even Point and Studio Profit Calculator

This is an extremely simplistic calculator to determine the break-even point of a film and how much the production studio is likely to gain or lose from it, based on the film's production budget, marketing budget, and for the net gain/loss, box office gross as well.

Once the three values are manually entered, the system automatically calculates and displays the result, while branding the movie as either a financial success or failure.

SEVERAL IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THE PROCESS (LISTED IN THE PROGRAM AS WELL):

-Production budgets are sometimes listed as a range (i.e. $150-200 million), and the TRUE production budget
of a movie is sometimes underreported by as much as 25% for years after the film first releases.
For best results, ASSUME IT TO BE THE HIGHEST CURRENTLY-PUBLISHED VALUE.

-Marketing budgets aren't usually published, but a standard industry estimate is usually HALF the production budget.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE MOVIE'S MARKETING BUDGET, EITHER ENTER HALF OF THE PRODUCTION BUDGET, OR "?" BELOW
(WHICH WILL CAUSE IT TO DEFAULT TO HALF).

-This calculates the amount of money earned by just the production company, as a significant cut of the profits
(regardless of whether or not the movie was successful) go to theaters. For American films,
this usually means the production company gets 50-55% of domestic revenue and 40% of international revenue,
averaging to about 50% of worldwide revenue overall (WHICH IS WHAT THIS CALCULATOR ASSUMES).

-This calculator only factors in theater revenue and costs and NOT additional factors like streaming revenue,
physical media sales, or merch sales (that could increase a movie's revenue during and/or after its theatrical run).

-This calculator assumes only a single, modern release for the movie in question. If there's more then
five to ten years of inflation to take into account, than the calculated profits/losses could be
significantly different than those for a more recent movie. However, you can take the net earnings from this and
plug it into an inflation calculator to get a semi-accurate modern equivalent.

-Rereleases over the course of several decades will also increase a movie's lifetime box office gross,
but different degrees of inflation during each release would also further complicate things and therefore,
aren't considered in this.

-Other minor expenditures that could also further cut into or divide a studio's profits like distribution fees
or backend deals are also not accounted for here.

-What constitutes a major or minor success or failure is somewhat subjective, but for the purposes of this calculator,
I had it call it based on how well the film performed relative to its break-even point
(and by extension, its production budget) and NOT in general. A $1 billion haul might be impressive for a film
that cost $200 million to make, but less so for a film that cost $300 million or more (if it even profited at all).

-The keyword with all of this is SIMPLE. As you can tell, there are a variety of metrics that determine
how much a studio makes from a movie, and this calculator exists to give a rough conservative approximation
based on the most crucial ones.
